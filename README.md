<h2 align="center"><b>About the Project</b></h4>

<p>Many travelers would like to see the weather outlook prior visiting their destinations. It would be nice to have a dashboard where they can search for the weather of cities to help them plan</p>

<hr />

<h4><u>User Story</u></h4>

    - AS A traveler
      I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
      SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

<h4><u>Acceptance Criteria</u></h4>

<p><b>GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs</b></p>

      - #1: WHEN I search for a city
            THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history

      - #2: WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
            THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index

      - #3: WHEN I view the UV index
            THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe

      - #4: WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
            THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity

      - #5: WHEN I click on a city in the search history
            THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
